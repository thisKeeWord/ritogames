###League of Legends
I really enjoy watching the LCS (League of Legends Championship Series) and enjoy working with numbers and statistical data.
Therefore, I decided to work with the Riot Games API to build my own little project, which will be iterated upon over and over again.

###What Does This Do?
This project grabs champion data and match statistics based on IGN (in game name) specified on the form. Unfortunately, Riot Games' API
requires style-specific inputs in order to properly send the data.
